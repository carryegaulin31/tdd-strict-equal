  <h1>Welcome to my story</h1>
  <p>Hello and welcome! Let me start off by introducing myself.
    My name is Carrye Gaulin and I am originally from Bangor, Maine. Don't let that fool you! I have ventured
    to farther off places. I have spent time living in various locations which include The U.S. Virgin Islands, the
    Florida Keys and the beaches of North Carolina. I absolutly love traveling to new places on exciting adventures.
    I love the sun, sand and absolutly any kind of fishing. Sounds nothing like sitting in front of a computer and
    creating does it? I have been interested in computers and what they can do since the first time I used one. Out
    of highschool I actually went into a computer science program. Circumstances beyond my control abruptly removed
    me from that path. Full circle 20+ years later I have returned, this time however, with an extremely successful
    sales skill and the same passion for the pursuit of knowledge in the computer science field. The road is
    challenging but what fun is life without a good challenge right?
